# Results
When looking at the dimensions of the data set we can see there are a lot of proteins
see table 1
```{r data_dimensions, echo = FALSE,}
pander(head(data_set[1:6]), n = 5)
cat("number of rows:", nrow(data_set),
    "number of columns:", ncol(data_set), '\n')
```
After this first assessment of the data we started looking at the number of missing values as seen in the figures' fig 1 and 2 below

![figure 1](../Analysis/data/figures/figure1.png)

![figure 2](../Analysis/data/figures/figure2.png)

As we can see in these figures 1 and 2 the distribution is very much to the left where a lot of proteins have one or only two missing values,
further more there are still a couple of proteins that have a high number of missing values these are to be filtered out because this can create a false set of results when we are using them in our machine learning algoritme for clustering them o there cancer stage.
so to further see how the data is we took the distribution of a couple of proteins in a multi boxplot as seen in figure 3

![figure 3](../Analysis/data/figures/figure3.png)

In this figure 3 we can clearly see that for the first 70 protein that most have a distribution of their log2 itraq expression between 5 and -5 but there are some that have higher numbers. to further make sense of all the 12 to 9 thousand proteins in the data we calculated the standard deviation of them see figure 4

![figure 4](../Analysis/data/figures/figure4.png)

In this figure 4 we compared the normal data set and the one filterd that has had protein with more tha 10% of their values missing removed.
In it, we can clearly see that a lot of proteins with high deviation are removed from the data. to make a further analyse of these samples

```{r plot figure, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "distribution of amount of samples per tumor stage"}
plot(data_set$Tumor, ylab = "Count", xlab="tumor stage", col ="#F9C000", main = "distribution of tumor stage")
```
In this figure 5 we can see how the different samples are spread according to there cancer stages.

# Discussion and Conclusion

In the results' section we can see from the figures 1 and two that although the data set was supplied with the label as high quality there are still proteins in the data with
more tha 10% of there expression values missing, this combined with the need for using the expressing data with the clinical categorical data, the sample names needed to be changed to be compared.
all this wasn't something to be expecting of high quality data. also in figure 5 it is clearly visible that the categorisation of the tumor stage there are a lot of T2 stages in the samples than any other.
furthermore the sheer amount of proteins recorded in this data is very useful for my purpose of trying to use another classification as the PAM50 protein list
