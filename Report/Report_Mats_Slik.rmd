# Results
When looking at the dimensions of the data set we can see there are allot of proteins
see table 1
```{r data_dimensions, echo = FALSE,}
pander(head(data_set[1:6]), n = 5)
cat("number of rows:", nrow(data_set),
    "number of columns:", ncol(data_set), '\n')
```
after this first assessment of the data we started looking at the number of missing values as seen in the figures fig 1 and 2 below

![figure 1](../data/figures/figure1.png)

![figure 2](../data/figures/figure2.png)


as we can see in thes figures 1 and 2 the distribution is very much to the left where allot of proetis have one or only two missing values,
further more there are still a couple of proteins that have a high number of missing values these are to be filtered out becaus this can create a false set of results when we are using them in oure machine learning algoritme for clustering them o there cancer stage.

so to furthere see how the data is we took the distribution of a couple of proteins in a mullti boxplot as seen in figure 3

![figure 3](../data/figures/figure3.png)

in this figure 3 we can clearly see that for the first 70 protein thaty most have a distribution of ther log2 itraq expression between 5 and -5 but there are some that have higher numbers. to further make sense of all of the 12 to 9 thousand proteins in the data we calculated the standard deviation of them see figure 4

![figure 4](../data/figures/figure4.png)

in this figure 4 we compared the normal data set and the one filterd that has had protein with more tha 10% of there values missing removed.
in it we can clearly see that allot of proteins with high deviation are removed from the data. to make a further analyse of thease samples
